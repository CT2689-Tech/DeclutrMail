# Mistakes — DeclutrMail

Append-only log of mistakes and the rules added so we never repeat them.

See CLAUDE.md §11. Append when a gate fires, a bug ships and is caught
later, or an approach turns out wrong.

## 2026-05-21 — Presented a "new" token-encryption decision that D14 already made
**PR:** #14 (`docs/d039-senders-backend-plan`) — caught before merge
**Caught by:** self — a plan grep for `D14` while finalizing the config file,
after the founder had already OK'd the wrong option.
**What happened:** PR-B needs OAuth-token encryption. I framed it to the
founder as an open choice — "app-level AES-256-GCM vs Cloud KMS" — and
recommended AES-256-GCM. The founder OK'd it. But **D14 is a locked
decision** that already mandates Google Cloud KMS envelope encryption,
and D14 explicitly argues against an env-var-class key. I had written
the choice into `senders-backend-plan.md` §4 and `FOUNDER-FOLLOWUPS.md`
as "RESOLVED — AES-256-GCM" before checking the plan. No code shipped;
caught while writing `.env.example`. Surfaced as plan-drift; founder
confirmed D14 stands; all docs corrected.
**Correct approach:** Before presenting ANY decision as open, grep the
plan for an existing D-decision on that topic. CLAUDE.md §1.1 says
"First, check the plan" — a token-encryption decision is exactly the
kind of thing the plan already settles. Had I grepped `D14` first, there
would have been no decision to present.
**Rule:** Before offering the founder a choice, `rg "encrypt|<topic>"`
the plan — if a D-decision covers it, follow it; only surface a *conflict*
if the codebase reality diverges. Never present a settled topic as open.
**Enforcement update:** none code-level — this is a §1.1 discipline miss.
Promote to CLAUDE.md §9 ("What to do if unsure" → step 1 already says
search the plan; reinforce it covers *decisions I'm about to present*,
not only blockers) if it recurs.

## 2026-05-20 — Visual pass shipped a desktop-only layout + a search dead-end
**PR:** #TBD — `feat/d038-senders-screen` (visual-optimization pass)
**Caught by:** Codex adversarial review + a browser check at 401 px
**What happened:** Two regressions in the visual-optimization pass.
(1) `sender-list-row.tsx` replaced an `auto` action column with a hard
`156px`. Row alignment was fixed, but the row's minimum width now
exceeds a phone viewport, and the parent scroll area clips overflow, so
row actions become unreachable. A browser check at 401 px showed the
whole shell non-responsive — the 220 px sidebar never collapses and
content is crushed to ~190 px. (2) The new `SenderSearch` typeahead drew
suggestions from the full sender list while the table stayed filtered by
category/facet; picking a suggestion for a filtered-out sender produced
an empty table that claimed "no match".
**Correct approach:** Build responsive from the start — mobile drawer in
`AppShell`, fluid grids, a row layout that reflows. Search stays global,
but picking a suggestion clears active filters so the result is always
visible.
**Rule:** Check any new screen/shell at a phone width before calling it
done. A fixed-width column is a layout regression unless the row can
still reflow under it.
**Enforcement update:** none — fixed in the follow-up pass (AppShell
drawer, auto-fit grids, responsive row, clear-filters-on-pick).

## 2026-05-20 — Review-session apply used if/else-if, dropped decisions
**PR:** #TBD — `feat/d038-senders-screen` (fixed in commit 215e9a0)
**Caught by:** gate review — typescript-reviewer + silent-failure-hunter
**What happened:** `applyReview` in `senders-screen.tsx` branched the
three verb buckets (Unsubscribe / Later / Protect) with `if … else if
… else if`. A mixed review session — some senders Unsubscribe, others
Later — fired only the first non-empty bucket and silently dropped the
rest. A trailing toast still announced "Also moved N to Later", so the
UI claimed work that never ran. The loose `string` typing of decision
values (no union) is what let producer and consumer drift without a
compile error.
**Correct approach:** Independent `if`s (or a loop over buckets) so every
bucket applies; type decision values as a closed union.
**Rule:** Branches that look mutually exclusive but are independent must
be independent `if`s, not an `if/else-if` chain. Model closed value sets
as union types so producer/consumer mismatches fail `tsc`.
**Enforcement update:** none — fixed in-PR (independent buckets +
`DecisionId` union). Behavioral; promote to CLAUDE.md §1 if it recurs.

## 2026-05-20 — Rename recon used an extension-filtered grep, missed config files
**PR:** #TBD — `chore/d173-rename-ui-to-shared`
**Caught by:** broad verification grep (later in the same session)
**What happened:** Scoping the `packages/ui` → `packages/shared` rename, the
recon `grep` used `--include=*.json --include=*.ts --include=*.tsx
--include=*.mjs --include=*.js --include=*.md --include=*.yaml`. It excluded
`.sh` and (by extension-name) `.yml`. The plan therefore claimed "no source
imports to update" and scoped the change to one agent file. The post-rename
verification grep (no filter) then found four more path refs: `subagent-gate.yml`
(`design` paths-filter), `require-preview-before-mutation.sh` (functional scope
glob), `check-microcopy.sh` (comment). The `subagent-gate.yml` one would have
silently disabled the design-system-agent gate on PR 3 — the opposite of the
PR's purpose.
**Correct approach:** Recon for a rename/move must grep the whole tree with no
`--include` filter. CI workflow YAML, shell hooks, and agent configs all
reference paths and are invisible to source-only greps.
**Rule:** When renaming or moving any path/package, grep unfiltered first —
`grep -rn '<oldpath>' --exclude-dir=node_modules --exclude-dir=.git .` — before
scoping the change. Never scope a rename off an extension-filtered grep.
**Enforcement update:** none — behavioral rule; promote to CLAUDE.md §1.3 if a
path-rename recon miss recurs.

## 2026-05-20 — packages/ui scaffolded against D173
**PR:** #TBD — `chore/d173-rename-ui-to-shared`
**Caught by:** session review (PR 3 prep)
**What happened:** PR 1 scaffolded a `packages/ui` workspace package
(`@declutrmail/ui`). D173 explicitly rejects it: *"packages/ui — only one
consumer (apps/web) at launch, doesn't earn package status."* The plan's
canonical shared package is `packages/shared` (D173, D198, D199, D210, D220 —
hooks, components, tokens, copy, types, Zod schemas).
**Correct approach:** Scaffold `packages/shared` per D173, not `packages/ui`.
**Rule:** Before creating a workspace package, confirm its name against the
plan's structure decisions (D173).
**Enforcement update:** none — one-off scaffold error; renamed to
`packages/shared` in this PR.
